# Reset-Normalize
## Drop-in & go already.

Includes:
- Box-sizing
- Selective margin/padding reset
- Normalize.css v3.0.3

SCSS files have been processed for those who aren't pre-processing - placed in the CSS directory. Read the comments in the scss/_reset.scss file even if you are not pre-processing - apply accordingly.

I might add the helper classes from HTML5 Boilerplate as well.

I hope other hard-boilers find this useful. This is just meant to get the crap out of the way so you can start writing your CSS immediately.
